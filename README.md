## Documentation
The speed test measurements are structured as follows:

| time | deviceid | v4_speed | v6_speed | latency_v4 | latency_v6 | dev_asn | day_no  | day | hr |
| ---  | ---      | ---  | ---       | ---      | ---    | ---     | ---   | ---   | ---   |

Ookla tests also include jitter in IPv4 and IPv6.
Filenames indicate the software (Ookla or NDT7), the direction (Upload or Download), and, in some cases, the speed test server's AS.
